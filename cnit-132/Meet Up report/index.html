            <h2>Short summary</h2>
                <p>This meetup was organised by 2 companies: Equalize Digital and WordPress.</p> 
                <p>The main speaker: Cam Beaudoin, President at A11y Coder, 
                talked about how to create web forms that are more accessible and usable, 
                as well as how to follow development best practices 
                and ensure functionality for as many audiences as possible.</p>
                <p>The meetup meets twice per month for presentations on a variety of 
                topics related to making WordPress websites that can be used 
                by people of all abilities. Meetups are held on the 1st
                Thursday of the month at 10 AM Central/8 AM Pacific and 
                on the 3rd Monday of the month at 7 PM Central/5 PM Pacific.</p>
                <p>In this meetup, I have learned a little bit more about how to create web forms that are more accessible 
                and usable, as well as how to follow development best practices and 
                ensure functionality for as many audiences as possible. Additionally,
                we have dipped into basic design principles, content writing, 
                and testing procedures</p>
