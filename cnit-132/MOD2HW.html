            <h2>Tips for better Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keywords - use the main words of your web site as many times as possible, and also in as many places as possible - for example in the title tag and in the webpage URL;</li>
                <li>Make the user stay on your page - use lots of bullets and subheadings;</li>
                <li>Create Attractive Page Titles and Headlines - create "clickable" titles which will attract users but also which are representing the content;</li>
                <li>Optimize your images - choose bright attractive images and shrink them to manageble size, so your size would be loading faster;</li>
                <li>Reduce load time - more than half of mobile users are leaving the web-page if it's slow loading. Test your speed and replace/optimize images and scripts;</li>
                <li>Put a lot of information in meta description - but not to much, search engines are frown on keyword stuffing. Example meta names: description, keywords, author etc.</li>
            </ul>
